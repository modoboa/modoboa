Modoboa

Modoboa is a mail hosting and management platform including a modern
and simplified Web User Interface. It provides useful components such
as an administration panel or a webmail.

Modoboa integrates with well known software such as `Postfix
<http://postfix.org/>`_ or `Dovecot <http://dovecot.org/>`_. A SQL
database (`MySQL <http://www.mysql.com>`_, `PostgreSQL
<http://www.postgresql.org/>`_ or `SQLite <http://www.sqlite.org>`_)
is used as a central point of communication between all components.

Modoboa is developed with modularity in mind, expanding it is really
easy. Actually, all current features are extensions.

It is written in Python and uses the `Django
<https://www.djangoproject.com>`_, `jQuery <http://jquery.com>`_ and
`Bootstap, from Twitter <http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>`_
frameworks.
